# Station
## What is Station?
A small roguelike written in Java. I didn't enter LD32, but I went with the "An Unconventional Weapon" theme and decided that the game would be about using oxygen starvation to kill hostiles. I'm aware that it comes across as very FTL inspired, and that's because it is. This is intended as a small game project that I actually complete, unlike my other large scale projects.
## Dependencies
Slick and LWJGL.
## Trivia
Development started on 22/5/2015.
